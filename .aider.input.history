+"Create a React-based Mini App for Base called 'Origin'.
+
+1. The Vibe (Professional Fintech):
+
+Design Style: Clean, minimalist, 'SaaS Dashboard' aesthetic.
+
+Color Palette: White background, black text, 'Inter' sans-serif font. Use a deep Indigo Blue (#4F46E5) for the primary action buttons and accents.
+
+Structure: A central 'Search' card floating in the middle of the screen.
+
+2. Core Logic (The 'Origin' Check):
+
+Input: A clean input field: 'Paste Token Contract'.
+
+Process:
+
+Simulate fetching the Top 20 Holders.
+
+The Anomaly Detection: Check the Funding Origin of these holders.
+
+Logic: If >3 of the top holders were funded by the same address (e.g., '0xSender...'), flag it as a 'Cluster Anomaly'.
+
+3. Visualization (The Output):
+
+Safety Score: A large, clean percentage ring (e.g., '85% Distributed').
+
+The 'Origin' Table: A minimal list showing the top 5 wallets and a column labeled 'Funded By'.
+
+Alerts: If a cluster is found, show a simple, non-alarmist badge: '⚠️ Common Funding Source Detected'."
